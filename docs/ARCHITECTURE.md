# Architecture

Cairn is a small **domain core** wrapped in **thin adapters** that shell out to
in-market tools. This file is the single source of truth for the design; iterations
([ITERATIONS.md](ITERATIONS.md)) reference it rather than restating it.

## Guiding constraints

1. **Never reimplement a tool.** Adapters shell out. The core knows *what* must happen
   (format, lint, test, bump…); adapters know *how* to ask a specific tool.
2. **Keep it simple.** Introduce an abstraction only when a second real case earns it.
3. **Hexagonal / DDD-light.** A pure domain core defines ports; the outside world
   (tools, filesystem, git, terminal) lives behind adapters.
4. **UX is a first-class concern**, not an afterthought — it has its own context.

## Bounded contexts

Each context is a package with a clear responsibility and a small public surface.

| Context              | Responsibility                                                        |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Config**           | Load/validate/merge `cairn.yaml`; the aggregate root for everything.  |
| **Detection**        | Find languages, their dirs, package managers, and installed tools.    |
| **QualityGate**      | Orchestrate `verify`: order steps, run them, collect results.         |
| **Versioning**       | SemVer/CalVer math; bump manifests; version/doc honesty checks.       |
| **Changelog**        | Promote/generate the changelog per chosen standard.                   |
| **CommitConventions**| Validate commit messages; infer the version bump from history.        |
| **Onboarding**       | The `init` wizard: detect → choose → write config + wiring.           |
| **Wiring**           | Generate/install git hooks and the CI workflow.                       |
| **UX/Reporter**      | Colorful, concise rendering: summaries, glyphs, spinners, verbosity.  |

## Ports (core interfaces)

The domain depends only on these. Adapters implement them; nothing in the core imports
a concrete tool.

- `ToolRunner` — run an external command, capture output/exit, respect timeout & cwd.
- `Formatter` / `Linter` / `TypeChecker` / `Tester` / `Builder` — one method each:
  `Run(ctx, LangUnit, Mode) StepResult` (Mode = check | fix).
- `VersionManager` — read current version, write a new one for a language manifest.
- `ChangelogWriter` — promote `[Unreleased]` → version, or generate from commits.
- `CommitValidator` — validate one message against the chosen convention; classify it
  (feat/fix/breaking) for bump inference.
- `Reporter` — the UX port (start/step/summary/error); has a TTY and a plain impl.

Adapters are thin and individually testable with a fake `ToolRunner`. Wherever a port has
more than one implementation, those implementations live as self-registering files inside
their context's package and are resolved through a registry — never a central map. This
is the repo-wide pattern; see "Extension points: pluggable by self-registration" below for
the registry table and the recipe.

## The config aggregate — `cairn.yaml`

The root `cairn.yaml` is **one override block** (the repo baseline, as plain top-level
keys) plus an optional `directories:` map of per-directory override blocks. The same
override block type is reused in three forms — the root baseline, a root
`directories.<path>` entry, and a directory's own `<path>/cairn.yaml` — so there is one
schema to learn, not four path-shapes. See "Per-directory config & precedence" below.

```yaml
schema: "2"                       # config *format* version (the format marker, not the
                                  # project version); absent ⇒ "2". A legacy `version: "1"`
                                  # / `project:` file is still accepted and translated.

# --- repo baseline: plain top-level keys, apply everywhere unless a directory overrides ---
version: "0.1.0"                  # the repo's version (source of truth for version-sync);
                                  # a directory that sets its own `version` versions
                                  # independently, otherwise it rides this one (lockstep).
versioning: semver                # semver | calver

languages:                        # tool/standard knobs ONLY — never locations.
  python: { standard: ruff }      #   ruff | black+flake8   (detection owns "where languages are")
  dart:   { strict: true }        #   override verify.strict for this language

verify:                           # global toggles; per-language / per-directory override allowed
  format:    { enabled: true,  required: true,  mode: check }
  lint:      { enabled: true,  required: true }
  typecheck: { enabled: true,  required: false }
  test:      { enabled: true,  required: true }
  build:     { enabled: false }
  strict:    false                # warnings/infos fatal where the linter has the tier
                                  # (dart --fatal-infos, eslint --max-warnings=0, biome
                                  # --error-on-warnings); repo default, override per language/dir

commits:
  convention: conventional        # conventional | gitmoji | none
  signoff: false                  # DCO
  validate_hook: true             # install commit-msg hook

changelog:
  standard: keepachangelog        # keepachangelog | dart | git-cliff | conventional-changelog
  file: CHANGELOG.md

version_sync:                     # the doc-honesty check (Cairn's signature feature)
  files:
    - { path: README.md, patterns: ["mylib:{VERSION}", "version-{VERSION}"] }

hooks: { pre_commit: [verify], commit_msg: [commit-lint], pre_push: [] }
ci:    { provider: github, jobs: [verify] }

addons: { editorconfig: false, license_header: false, branch_name: false }

# --- per-directory overrides: the SAME override block, keyed by repo-relative path ---
directories:                      # optional, sparse. Absent ⇒ detect everything, whole
                                  # repo follows the baseline `version` (lockstep).
  services/api:                   # independently versioned: own tag services/api-v2.1.0,
    version: "2.1.0"              #   own changelog. Overrides ANY baseline key, not just version.
    verify: { test: { required: false } }
  pkgs/cli:
    version: "2025.6.0"
    versioning: calver            #   its own scheme
    changelog: { standard: dart }
  vendor:
    enabled: false                # absolute disable: vendor's own cairn.yaml is never read,
                                  #   never detected, never verified, nothing under it runs.
```

A directory can equivalently carry its **own `<path>/cairn.yaml`**, holding the identical
override block (without the `directories:` key — a nested file is just an override block):

```yaml
# services/api/cairn.yaml
version: "2.1.0"
verify: { test: { required: false } }
```

Config is loaded once into a resolved **`Tree`** (see below), and the resolved view is
passed (read-only) into every context. Defaults live in code so a minimal `cairn.yaml` —
or none at all — still works.

### Per-directory config & precedence

The `config` context owns all per-directory complexity: it discovers nested
`<path>/cairn.yaml` files, applies the absolute disable gate, and folds the layers with a
field-level cascade. Every other context asks `config` for the resolved settings of a
directory (`Tree.Resolve(dir)`) instead of re-deriving precedence or reading YAML itself.

- **One override block, three forms.** The `Directory` type carries every baseline key,
  each optional (a nil pointer / absent map entry means "unset — inherit the lower
  layer"). It serves as the root baseline, as a root `directories.<path>` entry, and as a
  directory's own `cairn.yaml`. Designed once, serialized three ways.
- **Field-level precedence, layered low → high** (nearest wins, per field — not per
  block):
  1. **repo baseline** (root top-level keys);
  2. the directory's **own `cairn.yaml`** — and any ancestor's own file, outer → inner;
  3. root **`directories.<path>` entries** — and ancestors, outer → inner — **highest
     authority.**
  So an explicit root per-directory override **beats** that directory's own `cairn.yaml`;
  where the root is silent for a directory, the directory's own file governs. Worked
  examples (a Dart `strict` toggle):
  - root `directories.somerepo` sets `dart.strict: true`, `somerepo/cairn.yaml` says
    not-strict ⇒ **strict** (layer 3 over layer 2).
  - root has `strict` only at the top level, **no** `directories.somerepo` entry,
    `somerepo/cairn.yaml` says not-strict ⇒ **not-strict** (layer 2 over layer 1; layer 3
    empty).
- **Absolute disable gate, before any merge or file read.** A root
  `directories.<path>.enabled: false` (or any disabled ancestor) prunes the whole subtree:
  its own `cairn.yaml` is never read, no detection, no verify — nothing under it runs.
  This is the one place the root wins unconditionally. `Tree.Active()` / `Tree.Pruned()`
  enumerate the surviving vs cut directories.
- **Independent vs lockstep is a consequence, not a mode.** A directory with its own
  `version:` is independently versioned (own tag `<dir>-v<version>`, own changelog);
  without one it inherits the repo baseline `version` (lockstep). This subsumes the old
  `project.canonical_version` / `project.packages` split — lockstep is just "no directory
  set its own version."
- **Format version vs project version.** The repo's project version lives in the top-level
  `version:` key, so the config *format* version moved to its own `schema:` key (default
  `"2"`). A legacy `version: "1"` / `project:` file is detected and translated into the
  Tree (baseline + a root `directories.<path>` entry per old `project.packages` member),
  never silently misread.

## Data flow

**`cairn verify`**
`Config → Detection (which langs/tools are present) → QualityGate builds an ordered
plan (format→lint→typecheck→test→build per language, + version_sync honesty) →
runs each via its adapter through ToolRunner → Reporter renders a compact summary →
exit code = worst result.` Each detected unit's settings (languages standard/strict,
version_sync, target version, and whether it is active) come from `config`'s resolved
`Tree.Resolve(dir)`, so per-directory overrides and the disable gate apply without verify
knowing the precedence rules. Missing tool ⇒ behave per `required` (fail vs warn+skip with
install hint). A failed stage that can auto-repair (its adapter advertises a fix command)
prints that command plus `cairn verify --fix`; `--fix` re-runs every fixable stage in
write mode (format + fixable lints) before reporting whatever could not be repaired.

**`cairn bump <level|version>`**
`Config → Versioning computes next version (explicit, level, or inferred from commits) →
VersionManager updates each language manifest → version_sync rewrites doc patterns →
Changelog promotes [Unreleased] → Reporter prints diff summary + suggested commit/tag.
Never commits automatically.` A directory with its own `version` advances independently
(its own tag `<dir>-v<version>`); directories without one ride the repo baseline version
(lockstep) — both resolved from `config`'s `Tree`. A non-increasing bump is refused; the
direct path takes `--force` (`-f`) to permit a deliberate downgrade, mirroring the
wizard's double-confirm.

**`cairn init`**
`Detection → wizard (multiselect features + standards, smart defaults) → write
cairn.yaml → Wiring installs hook + generates CI → Reporter prints next steps.`

## Extension points: pluggable by self-registration (repo-wide pattern)

**This is the one extension pattern Cairn uses everywhere.** Any place the design admits
more than one implementation — a language, a manifest format, a changelog/commit/CI
standard — is a **registry** that implementations plug into by self-registering, never a
hardcoded list or a `switch` that grows per case. The rule:

> Each implementation lives in its own file in the context's package and registers itself
> in `init()` via that context's `register(key, …)`. A registry exposes a `…For(key)`
> resolver (one implementation) and a lister of registered keys (so the `init` wizard and
> `doctor` enumerate choices without a hardcoded list). Adding one is dropping one file;
> **no engine, central map, or CLI wiring is edited.** `register` panics on a duplicate key.

Why it works and why it's uniform: the registry and its implementations share the
context's package (mirroring `internal/detect`), so `init()` fires without blank imports;
and every context reads the same, so contributors learn the move once. Keep the surface
minimal — a registry is earned only when a second real implementation exists (per
"keep it simple"); the contexts below already have ≥2, which is why they use it.

| Registry (package)           | Key            | Plug-in file              | Resolver           |
| ---------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Detection (`detect`)         | language       | `lang_<name>.go`          | scan/registry      |
| QualityGate (`quality`)      | language       | `lang_<name>.go`          | `AdapterFor`       |
| Versioning (`version`)       | manifest type  | `manifest_<name>.go`      | `ManagerFor`       |
| Changelog (`changelog`)      | standard       | `std_<name>.go`           | `WriterFor`        |
| CommitConventions (`commit`) | convention     | `conv_<name>.go`          | `ValidatorFor`     |
| Wiring/CI (`wiring`)         | CI provider    | `ci_<name>.go`            | `ProviderFor`      |

Examples of the move:

1. **Add a language** = two files, nothing else: `internal/detect/lang_<name>.go`
   (`register(langSpec{…})` with markers → package manager, tools + install hints, skip
   dirs) and `internal/quality/lang_<name>.go` (`register(name, ctor)` with a `[]stepSpec`
   of kind + gating tool + exec). The shared `adapter`/`step` plumbing and
   `passOrFail`/`output` helpers live in `quality/adapter.go`, so a language file is just
   its stages.
2. **Add a standard** (changelog format, commit convention, CI provider) = one file in
   that context registering itself under its key; `bump`/`verify`/`init` resolve it from
   config without a code change.

A per-language *sub-choice* that doesn't warrant its own registry — e.g. ruff vs
black+flake8 within Python — stays a branch inside that language's `lang_<name>.go`,
keyed on the config's per-language `standard`. These `<plug-in>.go` files and this
section are the only places a language/standard is described, so code and docs stay in
sync.

## Implementation notes

- **Language:** Go — single static cross-platform binary, no runtime dependency in the
  user's repo, cobra for commands. (ADR-001)
- Run independent steps **concurrently** where safe; render results in stable order.
- Honor `NO_COLOR`, non-TTY (CI plain mode), `--quiet`, `--verbose`.

## ADRs (one-liners; expand only if reversed)

- **ADR-001 — Go as the implementation language.** Single binary, zero user-repo runtime
  dep, strong CLI ecosystem (cobra, charm).
- **ADR-002 — Shell out, never reimplement.** Cairn wraps tools; it owns glue, not logic.
- **ADR-003 — One config aggregate (`cairn.yaml`).** Single source of truth; code holds
  defaults so minimal configs work. The aggregate is resolved into a `Tree` of
  per-directory override blocks (one `Directory` type reused as the root baseline, root
  `directories.<path>` entries, and nested `<path>/cairn.yaml` files); `config` owns the
  field-level cascade and the absolute disable gate, so other contexts read
  `Tree.Resolve(dir)` and never parse YAML or re-derive precedence. See "Per-directory
  config & precedence."
- **ADR-004 — Hexagonal ports & adapters.** Keeps the core tool-agnostic and testable
  with fakes; makes new languages/standards additive.
- **ADR-005 — `verify` is the shared contract.** Hook and CI both call it, so local and
  CI never drift.
- **ADR-006 — Self-registration is the only extension pattern.** Every multi-implementation
  choice (language, manifest, changelog/commit/CI standard) is a registry whose entries
  live as `init()`-registering files in the context's own package and are resolved via a
  `…For(key)` lookup — no central map, switch, or blank-import list. Adding one touches no
  engine and no CLI wiring. Trade-off: a context's adapters share its package (they shell
  out, so they stay tool-agnostic anyway). Chosen over per-implementation packages, which
  would reintroduce a central import list and defeat self-registration. A registry is
  added only once a second real implementation exists.
